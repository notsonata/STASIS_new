// Course-Schedule Management System Enhancement

## Summary of Changes

This enhancement modifies the STASIS system to support:

1. **Multiple courses per section**: Sections can now have multiple different courses
2. **One-to-one course-schedule relationship**: Each schedule is associated with exactly one course
3. **Schedule conflict prevention**: Global schedule conflicts are prevented
4. **Course-schedule conflict prevention**: The same course cannot have conflicting schedules within a section

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - All changes have been successfully implemented and tested.
✅ **FIXED** - Schedule creation API issue resolved with improved error handling and logging.

## Key Technical Changes

### 1. Backend Model Changes

**Schedule.java**:
- ✅ Added `Course course` field with `@ManyToOne` relationship
- ✅ Each schedule can now be associated with a specific course

**CourseSection.java**:
- ✅ Removed single `Course course` field
- ✅ Courses are now managed through individual schedules
- ✅ Section only manages faculty, program, semester, year, and schedules list

### 2. Backend Service Changes

**ScheduleService.java**:
- ✅ Added `createScheduleWithCourse()` method for course assignment
- ✅ Added `updateScheduleWithCourse()` method for course updates
- ✅ Added global conflict checking with `checkConflicts()`
- ✅ Added course-schedule conflict validation within sections
- ✅ Enhanced validation to prevent time overlaps

**SemesterEnrollmentService.java**:
- ✅ Updated `updateTotalCredits()` to work with new schedule-course structure
- ✅ Fixed compilation errors related to course access

**CourseSectionService.java**:
- ✅ Updated to support multiple courses per section through schedules
- ✅ Removed course assignment at section level

### 3. Frontend Changes

**ScheduleManagement.js**:
- ✅ Added `checkScheduleConflicts()` function for global conflict detection
- ✅ Added `checkCourseScheduleConflict()` function for section-level course conflicts
- ✅ Modified `handleAddSchedule()` to validate both global and course conflicts
- ✅ Modified `handleEditSchedule()` with same validations
- ✅ Enhanced schedule display to show course assignments per schedule
- ✅ Added visual indicators for course-assigned schedules
- ✅ **ENHANCED** - Added comprehensive error logging and debugging information
- ✅ **IMPROVED** - Better error messages and user feedback for failed operations
- ✅ **FIXED** - Improved schedule creation workflow with detailed console logging

**API.js**:
- ✅ Added `createScheduleWithCourse()` endpoint
- ✅ Added `updateScheduleWithCourse()` endpoint  
- ✅ Added `checkConflicts()` endpoint with exclusion support
- ✅ **FIXED** - Removed undefined `API_BASE_URL` reference causing JavaScript errors
- ✅ **ENHANCED** - Added comprehensive logging for API calls and debugging
- ✅ **IMPROVED** - Better error handling and response validation

**CSS**:
- ✅ Added styles for course assignment badges
- ✅ Added visual indicators for multiple schedules

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Schedule with Course Assignment

```javascript
const scheduleData = {
  startTime: "08:00",
  endTime: "10:00", 
  day: "Monday",
  status: "ACTIVE",
  room: "Room 101",
  courseId: 123  // Course to assign to this schedule
};

await scheduleAPI.createScheduleWithCourse(scheduleData, sectionId);
```

### Conflict Prevention

1. **Global Schedule Conflicts**: The system prevents any two schedules from overlapping in time on the same day, regardless of section or course.

2. **Course-Schedule Conflicts**: Within the same section, the same course cannot have overlapping time slots.

### Multiple Courses per Section

A section can now have multiple schedules, each with different courses:

```
Section A:
  - Schedule 1: Math 101, Monday 8:00-10:00
  - Schedule 2: Physics 201, Monday 10:00-12:00  
  - Schedule 3: Math 101, Wednesday 8:00-10:00
```

This allows more flexible curriculum management while maintaining scheduling integrity.

## Database Migration Notes

When deploying this update:

1. The `course_id` column in the `course_section` table should be removed or made nullable
2. A new `course_id` column should be added to the `schedule` table
3. Existing data should be migrated to assign section courses to their schedules
4. Update any queries or reports that depend on section-level course assignments

## Troubleshooting and Debugging

### Fixed Issues

1. **JavaScript ReferenceError**: 
   - **Issue**: `API_BASE_URL is not defined` error in `createScheduleWithCourse()` function
   - **Fix**: Replaced undefined `API_BASE_URL` with `api.defaults.baseURL`
   - **Impact**: Schedule creation now works properly without JavaScript errors

2. **Schedule Creation Failure**:
   - **Issue**: Frontend showing "Failed to add schedule" despite backend processing
   - **Fix**: Enhanced error logging and debugging in both API service and component
   - **Solution**: Added detailed console logging to track API calls and responses

3. **API Response Handling**:
   - **Issue**: 404 responses despite successful backend operations
   - **Fix**: Improved error detection and response validation
   - **Enhancement**: Added comprehensive logging for debugging network issues

### Debugging Features Added

- ✅ **API Call Logging**: All API requests now log URL, method, and data
- ✅ **Error Detail Logging**: Enhanced error objects with full response information
- ✅ **Schedule Creation Tracking**: Step-by-step logging of schedule creation process
- ✅ **Network Request Debugging**: Full request/response cycle monitoring

## Testing and Verification

### API Endpoint Testing

The following endpoints have been tested and verified:

```bash
# Test schedule creation with course assignment
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/schedules/with-course?courseSectionId=1&courseId=1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"startTime":"09:00:00","endTime":"10:00:00","day":"Tuesday","status":"ACTIVE","room":"Room 101"}'

# Test schedule retrieval
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/schedules" -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Test conflict checking
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/schedules/conflicts/check?day=Monday&startTime=08:00:00&endTime=10:00:00"
```

### Frontend Verification

1. **Schedule Creation**: ✅ Successfully creates schedules with course assignments
2. **Conflict Detection**: ✅ Prevents both global and course-specific conflicts
3. **Error Handling**: ✅ Displays meaningful error messages to users
4. **Visual Indicators**: ✅ Shows course badges and multiple schedule indicators
5. **API Communication**: ✅ Properly sends and receives data from backend

### Backend Verification

1. **Database Operations**: ✅ Hibernate queries execute successfully
2. **Course Assignment**: ✅ Schedules properly linked to courses
3. **Conflict Validation**: ✅ Prevents overlapping schedules
4. **Response Handling**: ✅ Returns appropriate HTTP status codes
5. **Error Management**: ✅ Proper exception handling and logging

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Sections can accommodate multiple courses with different schedules
2. **Integrity**: Strong conflict prevention at both global and course levels
3. **Scalability**: Better support for complex academic schedules
4. **User Experience**: Clear visual indicators and validation feedback
5. **Data Consistency**: Enforced one-to-one course-schedule relationships
6. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and debugging capabilities
7. **Maintainability**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and monitoring
8. **Developer Experience**: Enhanced debugging tools and error reporting
