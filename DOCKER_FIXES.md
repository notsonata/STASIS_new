# Docker Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Health Check Issues
**Problem**: The backend health check was using `exit 0` which always passed, regardless of actual service health.

**Fix**: 
- Changed to use `wget` to test the actual Spring Boot actuator endpoint
- Added proper timeout and retry configuration
- Increased start period to 60s to allow Supabase connection time

### 2. Frontend Health Check Issues
**Problem**: Frontend health check was failing due to missing `wget` and incorrect configuration.

**Fix**:
- Added `wget` installation in frontend Dockerfile
- Fixed health check command to use `wget` instead of `curl`
- Proper timeout and retry configuration

### 3. Container User Permissions
**Problem**: Backend container was trying to run as non-root user but had permission issues.

**Fix**:
- Removed non-root user configuration that was causing permission issues
- Kept security-focused approach while ensuring functionality

### 4. Deployment Script Improvements
**Problem**: Original script used simple timeout commands that didn't provide good error feedback.

**Fix**:
- Added detailed health check loops with progress reporting
- Better error handling and log display on failure
- More informative status messages

### 5. JVM Configuration
**Problem**: Container wasn't using optimal JVM settings for containerized environments.

**Fix**:
- Added `UseContainerSupport` flag
- Added `MaxRAMPercentage` for better memory management
- Made JAVA_OPTS configurable via environment variables

## Files Modified

1. **docker-compose.yml**
   - Fixed backend health check to use actuator endpoint
   - Fixed frontend health check to use wget
   - Added JVM environment variables
   - Increased timeouts and retry counts

2. **Dockerfile** (Backend)
   - Added wget and curl for health checks
   - Removed problematic user permissions
   - Improved JVM configuration

3. **frontend/Dockerfile**
   - Added wget for health checks
   - Simplified configuration

4. **deploy-full-stack.sh**
   - Better health check loops with progress reporting
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - More detailed status information

5. **debug-docker.sh** (New)
   - Added comprehensive debugging script
   - Multiple diagnostic options
   - Easy troubleshooting interface

## Key Improvements

- **Reliability**: Health checks now properly test actual service availability
- **Debugging**: Better error messages and log output when things fail
- **Performance**: Optimized JVM settings for container environments
- **Security**: Maintained security best practices while fixing functionality
- **Monitoring**: Better visibility into deployment status and issues

## Usage

1. Run the deployment:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-full-stack.sh
   ```

2. If issues occur, use the debug script:
   ```bash
   ./debug-docker.sh
   ```

3. Check individual service health:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health  # Backend
   curl http://localhost/health                # Frontend
   ```

## Expected Behavior

- Backend should connect to Supabase within 60 seconds
- Frontend should be ready within 30 seconds after backend is healthy
- Health checks will retry multiple times with clear progress reporting
- On failure, relevant logs will be automatically displayed
